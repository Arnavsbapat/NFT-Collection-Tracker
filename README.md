# NFT Collection Tracker

## Introduction
This Aptos smart contract provides a simple implementation for tracking an NFT collection. It allows users to create new NFT collections, mint new NFTs, and manage the collection's metadata.

## Vision
The goal of this project is to offer a basic framework for building Aptos-based NFT applications. By providing a simple, yet extensible contract structure, developers can focus on building innovative features on top of a solid foundation.

## Future Goals
- Implement additional features such as royalties, transfers, and metadata extensions
- Provide sample client applications demonstrating how to interact with the contract
- Expand the contract to support more advanced NFT use cases (e.g. auctions, staking, etc.)
- Optimize the contract for gas efficiency and scalability
